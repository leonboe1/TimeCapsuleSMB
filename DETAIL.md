# TimeCapsuleSMB Detail Reference

This file is the long-form engineering reference for the current system.

It is intentionally denser than [README.md](README.md). The README is the user-facing overview. This file is for maintainers, contributors, and users who want the actual constraints, rationale, and implementation details in one place before they start modifying the box or the tooling.

## Current Working State

The current system works end to end on the target Apple AirPort Time Capsule.

What is working now:
- static Samba 4.25.0rc2 built from NetBSD 7 sources for NetBSD 6-era AirPort storage devices
- static Samba 4.25.0rc2 built from NetBSD 4 sources for older NetBSD 4-era AirPort storage devices
- static tiny SMB / Time Machine mDNS advertiser
- static NBNS responder for NetBIOS name discovery
- static `service` helper for NT hashing and network probes
- static `telemetry` helper for heartbeat reporting and signed debug execution
- boot-time runtime staging via `/mnt/Flash/rc.local`
- boot-time manager for `smbd`, the mDNS and telemetry helpers, and the optional NBNS and rsync services when enabled
- direct SMB service on port `445`
- Bonjour advertisement for:
  - managed `_smb._tcp`
  - managed `_adisk._tcp`
  - generated `_device-info._tcp`
  - generated `_airport._tcp`
  - optional generated `_afpovertcp._tcp` when AFP advertisement is enabled
  - generated USB printer records when applicable
- authenticated SMB access using:
  - examples and docs use Samba username `admin`
  - boot-time generated RAM auth stores a `root` Samba account
  - incoming SMB usernames are mapped to Unix `root`
  - password: the current AirPort device password read from `/usr/bin/acp -q syPW`
- guest access disabled
- deploy-time device compatibility detection
- manual NetBSD 4 activation via `tcapsule activate`
- manual disk repair via `tcapsule fsck`
- managed-file uninstall via `tcapsule uninstall`; firmware boot-hook patches are restored separately with `tcapsule flash --restore`

Current validation status:
- NetBSD 6 is validated end to end with reboot-persistent startup
- tested NetBSD 4 gen1 hardware without the firmware boot-hook patch is validated with manual `tcapsule activate` after reboot
- other unpatched NetBSD 4 generations may auto-start if their firmware runs `/mnt/Flash/rc.local` early in boot, but that is not yet confirmed

Current user experience:
- the Time Capsule advertises `_smb._tcp`
- the Time Capsule advertises `_adisk._tcp` for Time Machine
- the Time Capsule generates an Apple-compatible `_airport._tcp` record from live AirPort identity fields for AirPort Utility compatibility
- the Time Capsule can optionally answer NBNS name queries for the active runtime NetBIOS name
- the Bonjour instance name and Samba server string are derived from Apple `syNm`
- the Bonjour host label and Samba NetBIOS name are derived from `/bin/hostname`, with `syNm` fallbacks
- shares are derived from Apple `MaSt` volume metadata and are available as:
  - `smb://<advertised-host>.local/<sanitized and de-duplicated volume share name>`

Current auth model:
- the docs and examples use SMB login user `admin`
- the current AirPort device password is used as the SMB password
- boot-time generated Samba auth stores a `root` SMB account hash in RAM
- the username map currently maps incoming SMB usernames to Unix `root`
- filesystem access still runs as `root`
- this avoids the privilege-switch failures seen with non-root identities on this firmware

## Device Profile

The important target families are:

- NetBSD 6.x `evbarm`: 5th generation Time Capsules and same-era AirPort storage devices
- NetBSD 4.x `evbarm`: older little-endian AirPort storage devices
- NetBSD 4.x `armeb`: older big-endian AirPort storage devices
- AirPort Extreme devices with attached USB storage are supported by the same deploy/runtime model, but are less broadly validated than Time Capsule hardware

The details differ by generation, but the important shared constraints are:
- root fs is tiny
- flash is tiny
- `/mnt/Memory` is only about `16 MiB`
- the runtime has to fit in RAM while lock/cache databases can grow during client activity

Relevant mount points:
- `/` on `/dev/md0a`
- `/mnt/Flash` on `/dev/flash2a`
- `/mnt/Memory` on `tmpfs`
- internal HDD usually appears as `/dev/dk2` or `/dev/dk3`
- Apple’s expected mount point is `/Volumes/dk2` or `/Volumes/dk3`

Current live storage numbers observed during development:
- `/`: about `15.5 MiB` total, about `4.7 MiB` free
- `/mnt/Flash`: about `1 MiB` total, about `933 KiB` free
- `/mnt/Memory`: `16 MiB` total, with limited free headroom once Samba is staged
- `/Volumes/dk2`: effectively the large 2 TB data disk

These constraints drive almost every design decision in this repo.

Current deploy compatibility classification uses the NetBSD major version and detected ELF endianness; the reported architecture and AirPort identity narrow the displayed device candidates but do not select the payload by themselves:
- little-endian NetBSD 6.x: current `netbsd6_samba4` target, corresponding to 5th-generation Time Capsules and same-era AirPort devices
- little-endian NetBSD 4.x: `netbsd4le_samba4`, covering 3rd-4th-generation Time Capsules and 3rd-5th-generation AirPort Extreme hardware
- big-endian NetBSD 4.x: `netbsd4be_samba4`, covering 1st-2nd-generation Time Capsules and 1st-2nd-generation AirPort Extreme hardware
  - tested gen1 hardware without the firmware boot-hook patch needs manual `activate` after reboot
  - other generations may auto-start if their firmware runs `/mnt/Flash/rc.local`, but that is not yet confirmed

## Why The Current Architecture Exists

### Flash is too small

The flash filesystem cannot hold the real Samba runtime.

### Root is too small

The root filesystem is also too small to be the main runtime home.

### RAM is too small to be the persistent home

`/mnt/Memory` is only about `16 MiB`, and the staged Samba runtime consumes most of it. It is good for transient execution, not for persistence.

### The HDD is large but unreliable as an execution root

The internal HDD can be mounted locally and is fully usable for reads and writes.

However, Apple may later unmount or sleep the disk. Running `smbd` directly from `/Volumes/dk2` is therefore unsafe.

### Final result

The actual working split is:

- persistent payload on HDD:
  - `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/smbd`
  - `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/mdns-advertiser`
  - `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/nbns-advertiser`
  - `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/service`
  - `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/telemetry`
  - `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/rsync`
  - `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/rsyncd.conf`
  - `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/private/`
  - `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/private/xattr.tdb`
  - `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/cache`
  - `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/logs/`
- tiny persistent boot hook on flash:
  - `/mnt/Flash/rc.local`
  - `/mnt/Flash/common.sh`
  - `/mnt/Flash/boot.sh`
  - `/mnt/Flash/manager.sh`
  - `/mnt/Flash/dfree.sh`
  - `/mnt/Flash/mdns-advertiser`
  - `/mnt/Flash/tcapsulesmb.conf`
- transient runtime on RAM disk:
  - `/mnt/Memory/samba4`
  - `/mnt/Memory/debug` and `/mnt/Memory/debug.sig` for temporary signed debug execution
  - `/mnt/Locks`

This gives:
- persistence on disk
- safe execution from RAM
- only tiny always-mounted files on flash

Current naming split:
- `.samba4` is the fixed managed persistent HDD payload directory
- the live RAM runtime path is intentionally fixed at `/mnt/Memory/samba4`
- share names are not configured locally; runtime sanitizes and de-duplicates the Apple `MaSt` partition names

## Why Samba 4.8, Then 4.25.0rc2

The project did not land on Samba 4.x by accident. Samba 4.8 was the first fully working Time Machine target on this hardware; the current checked-in deploy artifacts are Samba 4.25.0rc2.

### Samba 3

Samba 3.x worked well enough to prove the device could serve files, and was a small 6MB, but has issues with directory traversal with NetBSD 6. This meant `ls` would not work in the Samba share. As Samba 3.x was the first version with SMB2 support, it was rather incomplete and buggy.

### Samba 4.0

Tried 4.0 as it in theory had better SMB2 support than 3.x but it had the same directory traversal bug. It was significantly harder to compile than 3.x but a lot easier than 4.2-4.8, so it served well as a stepping stone in getting 4.8 to work as trying to compile 4.8 from scratch at first drove me crazy.

### Samba 4.2

Samba 4.2 was built successfully, but it hit a runtime bug on-device:
- a `talloc` / `loadparm` use-after-free class issue on first client session

Separately, the NetBSD 10-era toolchain path also exposed incompatible directory API behavior on the NetBSD 6 box.

### Samba 4.3

Samba 4.3 was an important stepping stone, but it was not enough. It did not run into any bugs as a network file share. It worked as a normal authenticated network share, but not as a real Time Machine target. 

In practice, 4.3 proved the architecture and deployment model, while 4.8 was the version that first enabled the full Time Machine-oriented share behavior.

### Samba 4.8

Samba 4.8 was the first stable target because it gave the project a usable Time Machine stack through `vfs_fruit`.

### Samba 4.25.0rc2

Samba 4.25.0rc2 is the current shipped target. It keeps the same static-module deployment model, but uses the newer `samba4x` build lanes and checked-in artifacts.

With the current static-module build, the shipped config supports:
- `catia`
- `fruit`
- `streams_xattr`
- `acl_xattr`
- `xattr_tdb`
- optional `aio_fork`, disabled by default and bounded to eight children per share when enabled
- `fruit:time machine = yes`

## NetBSD 6 build path

As the Time Capsule ran NetBSD 6, initial attempts used the NetBSD 6 source code to attempt to build. This failed terribly, as it turns out the NetBSD 6 source did not support earmv4 build output. I presume Apple used some custom toolchain. 

### NetBSD 10 build path

My VM was running NetBSD 10. A NetBSD 10-generated static binary could execute, and it worked fine for Samba 3.x, but later direct directory probes confirmed that important directory APIs failed on the Time Capsule. That made the NetBSD 10 route unacceptable for full Samba serving.

### NetBSD 7 build path

The first working result came from:
- NetBSD 7 source tree
- static `earmv4` build
- Samba 4.8.x

That combination:
- builds reproducibly
- executes correctly on the Time Capsule
- serves files successfully
- supports Time Machine semantics through `vfs_fruit`

The current deploy artifacts use Samba 4.25.0rc2 on the same NetBSD 7 / NetBSD 4 SDK split.

The important build logic is now under [build/](build). The VM-side [build/Makefile](build/Makefile) names the supported per-family and all-lane targets while leaving the expensive SDK download/bootstrap steps explicit rather than making them artifact-build dependencies.

Current maintainer build lanes:
- NetBSD 7 SDK lane:
  - [build/download.sh](build/download.sh)
  - [build/bootstrap.sh](build/bootstrap.sh)
- NetBSD 4 SDK lane:
  - [build/downloadoldle.sh](build/downloadoldle.sh)
  - [build/bootstrapoldle.sh](build/bootstrapoldle.sh)
  - [build/downloadoldbe.sh](build/downloadoldbe.sh)
  - [build/bootstrapoldbe.sh](build/bootstrapoldbe.sh)
- NetBSD 7 current Samba 4.24 lane:
  - [build/downloadsamba4x.sh](build/downloadsamba4x.sh)
  - [build/samba4x.sh](build/samba4x.sh)
- NetBSD 4 current Samba 4.24 lanes:
  - [build/downloadsamba4xoldle.sh](build/downloadsamba4xoldle.sh)
  - [build/downloadsamba4xoldbe.sh](build/downloadsamba4xoldbe.sh)
  - [build/samba4xoldle.sh](build/samba4xoldle.sh)
  - [build/samba4xoldbe.sh](build/samba4xoldbe.sh)
- legacy Samba 4.8 lanes:
  - [build/downloadsamba4.sh](build/downloadsamba4.sh)
  - [build/samba4.sh](build/samba4.sh)
  - [build/downloadsamba4oldle.sh](build/downloadsamba4oldle.sh)
  - [build/downloadsamba4oldbe.sh](build/downloadsamba4oldbe.sh)
  - [build/samba4oldle.sh](build/samba4oldle.sh)
  - [build/samba4oldbe.sh](build/samba4oldbe.sh)
- NetBSD 7 utility lanes:
  - [build/hello.sh](build/hello.sh)
  - [build/mdns.sh](build/mdns.sh)
  - [build/nbns.sh](build/nbns.sh)
- NetBSD 4 utility lanes:
  - [build/hellooldle.sh](build/hellooldle.sh)
  - [build/hellooldbe.sh](build/hellooldbe.sh)
  - [build/mdnsoldle.sh](build/mdnsoldle.sh)
  - [build/mdnsoldbe.sh](build/mdnsoldbe.sh)
  - [build/nbnsoldle.sh](build/nbnsoldle.sh)
  - [build/nbnsoldbe.sh](build/nbnsoldbe.sh)

The direct scripts target the NetBSD 7 lane by default. The `*oldle.sh` and `*oldbe.sh` wrappers select the NetBSD 4 little-endian and big-endian lanes.

## Why We Generate Apple-Compatible mDNS And Override SMB / Time Machine

This was investigated deeply.

Apple’s stack does have a native SMB/mDNS path involving:
- `/etc/cifs/cm_cfg.txt`
- Apple disk metadata exposed through `acp MaSt`
- `wcifsfs`
- `mDNSResponder`
- `ACPd`

Important findings:
- Apple’s own `_smb._tcp` and `_adisk._tcp` paths are coupled to Apple’s file-sharing stack
- when Apple’s stack owns those paths, Finder tends to reconnect through Apple SMB/AFP rather than our Samba service
- Apple’s `_airport._tcp` is still valuable because AirPort Utility depends on it
- some Apple-advertised services such as USB printer advertisements should be preserved if present
- the current Samba runtime uses `MaSt` as the source of truth for volumes and ADISK UUIDs; it does not read `/etc/cifs/cs_cfg.txt`

So the current system does not hand control back to Apple mDNS for SMB and Time Machine, but it also does not discard the Apple device identity users expect. Instead it uses a separate tiny helper:
- [bin/mdns/mdns-advertiser](bin/mdns/mdns-advertiser)

This helper:
- derives Apple-compatible `_airport._tcp` fields from local AirPort identity values
- can advertise USB printer services when a local AirPort printer identity is present
- advertises managed records for:
  - `_smb._tcp.local.`
  - `_adisk._tcp.local.`
- can suppress managed SMB/ADISK records in diskless mode while keeping generated AirPort identity records
- aggressively terminates Apple `mDNSResponder` during takeover and binds UDP `5353`
- continues to point clients at our `smbd` on port `445`

Current practical result:
- Our `_smb._tcp` and `_adisk._tcp` remain authoritative
- Apple `_airport._tcp` identity can still be advertised for AirPort Utility
- attached USB printer advertisements can be generated from local AirPort printer metadata

## Bonjour Discovery Boundaries

Local Bonjour discovery is intentionally service-centric. `timecapsulesmb.discovery.bonjour.discover()` returns one normalized record per service instance, not one merged record per physical device.

That distinction matters:
- `_airport._tcp.local.` is the Apple device identity and is the only service configure uses for the interactive device list
- `_smb._tcp.local.` is the managed Samba service identity and is what doctor/deploy Bonjour checks use
- `_device-info._tcp.local.` may share the same name, hostname, and IP as `_smb._tcp.local.`, but it must remain a separate raw record

Do not merge `_airport`, `_smb`, and `_device-info` records inside `bonjour.discover()`. Merging service records creates ambiguous objects with one name/hostname but multiple meanings, and it causes duplicate-looking or misleading configure/doctor output. The stored `service_type` should remain the raw observed value. Callers should filter raw discovery results by the service prefix they actually need, such as `_airport` for configure and `_smb` for doctor/deploy. Prefix filtering intentionally matches both `_smb._tcp.local.` and `_smb._tcp.local`.

## Generated mDNS Records

Current behavior:
- `boot.sh` prepares the RAM runtime and launches `manager.sh`
- `manager.sh` continuously reconciles usable network addresses, payload state, and AirPort identity data; it can continue in diskless mode when no payload is available and can omit `_airport._tcp` when optional clone identity fields are unavailable
- the manager launches `mdns-advertiser` from `/mnt/Flash` with generated AirPort identity fields
- `mdns-advertiser` generates managed `_smb._tcp`, `_adisk._tcp`, `_device-info._tcp`, and `_airport._tcp` records from live runtime state
- when a USB printer is attached and discoverable through AirPort metadata, the manager also passes `_riousbprint._tcp` and `_pdl-datastream._tcp` arguments
- if the disk payload is unavailable, the manager can launch the advertiser in diskless mode so AirPort identity remains visible while SMB/ADISK records are suppressed
- `mdns-advertiser` kills Apple `mDNSResponder` during takeover and keeps UDP `5353` owned by the managed helper

## Boot Flow In Detail

The boot logic lives in:
- [src/timecapsulesmb/assets/boot/samba4/rc.local](src/timecapsulesmb/assets/boot/samba4/rc.local)
- [src/timecapsulesmb/assets/boot/samba4/boot.sh](src/timecapsulesmb/assets/boot/samba4/boot.sh)
- [src/timecapsulesmb/assets/boot/samba4/manager.sh](src/timecapsulesmb/assets/boot/samba4/manager.sh)
- [src/timecapsulesmb/assets/boot/samba4/common.d/](src/timecapsulesmb/assets/boot/samba4/common.d)

### `rc.local`

`rc.local` is intentionally tiny. It just backgrounds `boot.sh`.

This matters because:
- boot ordering is messy
- the HDD device nodes may not exist yet when `rc.local` first runs
- a longer wait loop belongs in the second-stage script, not directly inline in the boot hook

### `boot.sh`

`boot.sh` performs the one-shot startup preparation:

1. sources `/mnt/Flash/common.sh` and `/mnt/Flash/tcapsulesmb.conf`
2. kills any prior managed `smbd`, mDNS advertiser, NBNS responder, and manager
3. prepares the dedicated Samba lock ramdisk at `/mnt/Locks`
4. recreates the RAM runtime tree under `/mnt/Memory/samba4`
5. prepares compatibility symlinks under `/root`
6. starts `manager.sh` if it is not already running

The manager owns disk discovery, Samba staging, service startup, mDNS takeover, NBNS startup, and later recovery. Telemetry schedules its own heartbeat cycles.

The boot log is written to:
- `/mnt/Memory/samba4/var/rc.local.log`

Long-running process logs are split between RAM and the selected payload:
- `/mnt/Memory/samba4/var/manager.log`
- `/mnt/Memory/samba4/var/rsync.log`
- `<payload>/logs/mdns.log`, with a RAM fallback in diskless state
- `<payload>/logs/nbns.log`, with a RAM fallback in diskless state
- `<payload>/logs/log.smbd`

Important bug lessons from getting this stable:
- the script cannot assume `/dev/dk2` exists immediately
- AirPort Extreme devices may have no internal disk at all
- the script must use `-b` for block devices, not `-c`
- it cannot call non-existent utilities like `dirname`
- it must tolerate a long delay before the disk appears
- the Samba lock TDBs need their own ramdisk because `/mnt/Memory` is too small for the runtime plus growing lock databases
- on NetBSD 4, cache state is kept on the HDD instead of `/mnt/Memory` to preserve RAM-disk headroom
- the persistent `xattr.tdb` must stay in the selected payload home so all shares use a single private database

### `/mnt/Locks`

Samba lock state now lives on a dedicated second ramdisk:
- `lock directory = /mnt/Locks`

Current mount behavior:
- NetBSD 6 mounts a `4 MiB` `tmpfs` at `/mnt/Locks` with `mount_tmpfs -s 4m`
- NetBSD 4 mounts a `4 MiB` `mfs` ramdisk at `/mnt/Locks` with `mount_mfs -s 8192`
- if the NetBSD 6 tmpfs mount fails, startup falls back to a plain `/mnt/Locks` directory on the root filesystem
- if the NetBSD 4 mfs mount fails, startup aborts instead of falling back to the tiny root filesystem

Operational behavior:
- `boot.sh` clears `/mnt/Locks/*` during startup preparation
- `manager.sh` clears `/mnt/Locks/*` before restarting `smbd`

### `manager.sh`

`manager.sh` is the long-running supervisor launched at boot from flash.

Current behavior:
- runs a disk/topology pass every `10` seconds
- runs a Samba bind pass every `10` seconds by default
- runs a full managed service pass every `30` seconds
- retries failed recovery work on the next due pass
- reads `MaSt` directly through the shared runtime helpers
- debounces disk topology changes before applying runtime updates
- requests `diskd.useVolume` for valid `MaSt` volumes and builds current share/ADISK state from mounted volumes
- applies share path rules:
  - external volumes always share `/Volumes/dkN`
  - internal volumes share `/Volumes/dkN/ShareRoot` unless `INTERNAL_SHARE_USE_DISK_ROOT=1`
  - internal `ShareRoot` is created when needed
- resolves the persistent payload by scanning mounted `MaSt` volumes in internal-first order for `.samba4`
- writes current `adisk.tsv` under `/mnt/Memory/samba4/var`
- copies `smbd`, `service`, `telemetry`, optional `nbns-advertiser`, and enabled rsync files into RAM when inputs change
- generates `/mnt/Memory/samba4/etc/smb.conf` directly from runtime state
- starts or reloads `smbd` as needed and keeps it bound to the current interfaces
- starts generated mDNS advertisement from `/mnt/Flash/mdns-advertiser`
- starts NBNS when `NBNS_ENABLED=1`
- starts `telemetry --daemon` from RAM
- starts rsync from RAM when `RSYNC_ENABLED=1`
- if the payload volume is unavailable, stops managed Samba/NBNS/rsync, keeps the applicable diskless mDNS identity service and staged telemetry, and retries later
- if disk, identity, network, or USB printer state changes, refreshes the affected generated config and service state

The manager prefers the least disruptive reconciliation that is safe:
- config-only Samba changes normally use a parent-only SIGHUP so active sessions can survive
- `smbd` is restarted when its binary or bind interfaces change, required TCP `445` listeners disappear, or a SIGHUP reload fails
- disk, identity, network, or printer changes can replace the mDNS advertiser so its generated records remain coherent
- topology changes are reconciled in the running manager rather than literally repeating the one-shot boot path

The manager log is always written to `/mnt/Memory/samba4/var/manager.log` and is therefore ephemeral.

Important implementation detail:
- `mdns-advertiser` fits the target `ucomm` limit and is matched by its full exact process name
- liveness and restart helpers ignore zombie processes and use anchored process-name matching

NetBSD 4-specific shell note:
- backgrounded jobs redirect stdin from `/dev/null` so they do not hold the SSH session open during manual activation

## Optional rsync Daemon

Deploy always installs the device-family rsync binary and its generated daemon configuration in the selected HDD payload:

- `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/rsync`
- `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/rsyncd.conf`

Installation and enablement are separate. The macOS app exposes **Enable rsync** in both the Install options and saved device settings, while the CLI uses:

```bash
.venv/bin/tcapsule deploy --enable-rsync
```

That selection is persisted as `RSYNC_ENABLED=0|1` in `/mnt/Flash/tcapsulesmb.conf`. The binary and configuration stay on the HDD either way. On a successful app deploy, the selected value is also saved to the device profile and restored into later Install sessions. Existing profiles that predate this setting default to disabled.

When rsync is enabled, the manager:

1. discovers the currently mounted payload volume and creates its `ShareRoot` if needed
2. copies the rsync binary to `/mnt/Memory/samba4/sbin/rsync`
3. stages `/mnt/Memory/samba4/etc/rsyncd.conf`, rewriting the module path to the payload volume's current `/Volumes/dkN/ShareRoot` mount rather than trusting its deploy-time device number
4. starts the RAM copy with `--daemon --no-detach`
5. verifies the live `rsync` process owns TCP port `873`

The daemon exposes a writable, unauthenticated module named `shareroot`. Only enable it on a trusted network. Its log lives at `/mnt/Memory/samba4/var/rsync.log` and uses the same shared runtime log bounding helper as the other managed services, with the normal `32768`-byte limit.

Disabling rsync on a later deploy leaves the persistent HDD files installed, but the manager stops the daemon and removes the RAM binary and configuration. No rsync PID file is used: the manager relies on live process and socket probes and stops the exact `rsync` process name. This deliberately avoids stale runtime state files.

## SMB Runtime Layout

When boot succeeds, the runtime tree under `/mnt/Memory/samba4` contains:
- `sbin/smbd`
- `sbin/service`
- `sbin/telemetry`
- optionally `sbin/nbns-advertiser`
- optionally `sbin/rsync`
- `etc/smb.conf`
- optionally `etc/rsyncd.conf`
- `var/`
- `locks/`
- `private/`

Current auth files are generated during runtime staging and live only in RAM:
- `/mnt/Memory/samba4/private/smbpasswd`
- `/mnt/Memory/samba4/private/username.map`

The selected payload home still contains `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/private/` for persistent Samba metadata such as `xattr.tdb`.

Current NBNS binary also lives in the selected payload home:
- `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/nbns-advertiser`

NBNS runtime enablement lives in flash config:
- `/mnt/Flash/tcapsulesmb.conf`
- `NBNS_ENABLED=0|1`

Current persistent Time Machine metadata state also lives in the selected payload home:
- `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/private/xattr.tdb`

Current NetBSD 4 Samba cache state lives on the HDD to preserve RAM headroom:
- `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/cache`

NetBSD 6 note:
- the normal NetBSD 6 runtime keeps Samba cache state in `/mnt/Memory/samba4/var`
- the HDD cache path above is used for the NetBSD 4 payload family because the NetBSD 4 RAM disk is too tight for the full runtime plus cache TDB growth

Current rendered Samba config characteristics:
- `netbios name = <runtime hostname-derived name>`
- `server string = <runtime Apple syNm-derived name>`
- `security = user`
- `min protocol = SMB2` and `max protocol = SMB3` by default
- protocol and signing/encryption override modes can omit or replace those defaults
- `guest ok = no`
- `valid users = root`
- `force user = root`
- `force group = wheel`
- `reset on zero vc = yes`
- share paths are generated from `MaSt`
- internal default: `path = /Volumes/dkN/ShareRoot`
- external default: `path = /Volumes/dkN`
- `pid directory = /mnt/Memory/samba4/var`
- `lock directory = /mnt/Locks`
- `state directory = /mnt/Memory/samba4/var`
- `cache directory = /mnt/Memory/samba4/var` on NetBSD 6
- `cache directory = /Volumes/dkX/.samba4/cache` on NetBSD 4
- `private dir = /mnt/Memory/samba4/private`
- `log file = /Volumes/dkX/.samba4/logs/log.smbd`
- `max log size = 128` in the normal generated config
- `deadtime = 720`
- `vfs objects = catia fruit streams_xattr acl_xattr xattr_tdb`
- when `TC_VFS_AIO_FORK_ENABLED=true`, append `aio_fork`, cap each share at `aio_fork:max_children = 8`, set 128 KiB SMB2 read/write limits, and enable AIO for requests of at least one byte
- `fruit:resource = file`
- `fruit:veto_appledouble = yes`
- `fruit:metadata = netatalk` by default, or `fruit:metadata = stream` when Netatalk metadata mode is explicitly disabled
- `fruit:time machine = yes`
- `fruit:posix_rename = yes`
- `acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes`
- `xattr_tdb:file = /Volumes/dkX/.samba4/private/xattr.tdb`
- `veto files = /.samba4/` on every share so the payload is hidden when it lives on a shared disk root

Current auth mapping:
- the docs and examples use `admin` as the normal user-facing SMB login name
- the RAM `smbpasswd` backend contains a `root` entry generated from live AirPort `syPW`
- RAM `username.map` contains:
  - `!root = root`
  - `root = *`
- incoming SMB usernames are mapped to Unix `root`

This is intentionally pragmatic:
- login is authenticated
- the filesystem still runs as `root`
- it avoids the earlier non-root privilege-switch failures on this firmware

Operational note:
- the live runtime config at `/mnt/Memory/samba4/etc/smb.conf` is regenerated on each boot
- `/mnt/Memory` is a RAM disk, so live edits there are ephemeral
- temporary debug edits such as one-off `log level = ...` lines will disappear after reboot
- manager logs under `/mnt/Memory/samba4/var` are also ephemeral for the same reason

## mDNS Advertiser Details

The mDNS helper is:
- [bin/mdns/mdns-advertiser](bin/mdns/mdns-advertiser)

It is built from:
- [build/native/mdns/](build/native/mdns/)
- [build/mdns.sh](build/mdns.sh)

Important properties:
- static NetBSD 7 `earmv4` binary for the NetBSD 6 payload
- static NetBSD 4 little-endian `earmv4` binary for the NetBSD 4 little-endian payload
- static NetBSD 4 big-endian `armeb` binary for the NetBSD 4 big-endian payload
- see the artifact section below for current checked-in binary sizes
- installed on both the HDD payload and `/mnt/Flash`
- run from `/mnt/Flash` to save RAM-disk space

At runtime it can:
- advertise managed `_smb._tcp.local.`
- advertise managed `_adisk._tcp.local.`
- advertise managed `_device-info._tcp.local.`
- advertise generated `_afpovertcp._tcp.local.` on port `548` when `MDNS_ADVERTISE_AFP=1`; this is off by default
- advertise generated `_airport._tcp.local.` records from local AirPort identity fields
- optionally advertise `_riousbprint._tcp.local.` and `_pdl-datastream._tcp.local.` for an attached USB printer
- suppress SMB/ADISK records in diskless mode while preserving generated AirPort identity records
- aggressively take over UDP `5353` from Apple `mDNSResponder`
- track runtime interface changes in auto-IP mode

Current validation and behavior notes:
- mDNS host labels are validated as DNS-label-safe host labels
- mDNS instance names may contain spaces and are validated separately from host labels
- service types are validated as dotted DNS names
- `_adisk._tcp` TXT payload sizing is validated before advertisement
- `_airport._tcp` fields are all optional; missing fields are simply omitted from the TXT payload

## NBNS Responder Details

The NBNS helper is:
- [bin/nbns/nbns-advertiser](bin/nbns/nbns-advertiser)

It is built from:
- [build/native/nbns/](build/native/nbns/)
- [build/nbns.sh](build/nbns.sh)

Important properties:
- static NetBSD 7 `earmv4` binary for the NetBSD 6 payload
- static NetBSD 4 little-endian `earmv4` binary for the NetBSD 4 little-endian payload
- static NetBSD 4 big-endian `armeb` binary for the NetBSD 4 big-endian payload
- enabled by default at runtime
- always deployed to the HDD payload, but only staged into RAM when enabled

Current behavior:
- binds UDP port `137`
- answers NBNS name queries for the active runtime NetBIOS name
- answers NBSTAT/node-status queries, including wildcard node-status requests
- replies for both NetBIOS suffixes:
  - `0x00`
  - `0x20`
- chooses a response IPv4 from the interface whose subnet matches the requester
- declines ambiguous off-subnet requests rather than returning an arbitrary address
- refreshes its interface topology every `30` seconds so address changes do not require a process restart

Enablement model:
- the binary is uploaded to `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/nbns-advertiser` on every deploy
- runtime enablement is controlled by:
  - `NBNS_ENABLED=1` in `/mnt/Flash/tcapsulesmb.conf`
- plain `tcapsule deploy` writes that flash config value
- `--no-nbns` writes `NBNS_ENABLED=0`
- `--no-nbns` is supported on both NetBSD 6 and NetBSD 4
- `uninstall` removes both the binary and flash runtime config

## Service and Telemetry Helpers

The RAM-staged `service` helper provides NT hashing and live network probes previously bundled into `mdns-advertiser`. The `telemetry` helper posts a heartbeat at startup and every 12 hours, and downloads and runs a signed debug executable only after verifying signed server authorization. See [build/native/README.md](build/native/README.md) for sources, commands, protocol, and cleanup behavior.

## Current User-Facing Workflow

The intended user flow is:

1. bootstrap the local host
   - [`./tcapsule bootstrap`](./tcapsule)
2. generate local config and enable SSH when needed
   - [src/timecapsulesmb/cli/configure.py](src/timecapsulesmb/cli/configure.py)
3. deploy and reboot
   - [src/timecapsulesmb/cli/deploy.py](src/timecapsulesmb/cli/deploy.py)
4. on NetBSD 4, optionally back up and inspect the firmware, then install the persistent boot hook with `tcapsule flash --patch` and manually power-cycle after a successful write
   - [src/timecapsulesmb/cli/flash.py](src/timecapsulesmb/cli/flash.py)
5. activate older NetBSD 4 devices that do not have the persistent hook or do not auto-start Samba after reboot
   - [src/timecapsulesmb/cli/activate.py](src/timecapsulesmb/cli/activate.py)
6. run local diagnostics
   - [src/timecapsulesmb/cli/doctor.py](src/timecapsulesmb/cli/doctor.py)
7. optionally repair the HDD before redeploying
   - [src/timecapsulesmb/cli/fsck.py](src/timecapsulesmb/cli/fsck.py)
8. remove the payload later if needed
   - [src/timecapsulesmb/cli/uninstall.py](src/timecapsulesmb/cli/uninstall.py)

`tcapsule set-ssh` still exists as an advanced SSH toggle helper, but it is no longer part of the normal setup flow.

`tcapsule configure` writes repo-root `.env` by default; `--config` or `TCAPSULE_CONFIG` can select another path.

Current important `.env` values include:
- `TC_HOST`
- `TC_PASSWORD`
- `TC_SSH_OPTS`
- `TC_INTERNAL_SHARE_USE_DISK_ROOT`
- `TC_SMB_BIND_LAN_ONLY`
- `TC_SMB_BROWSE_COMPATIBILITY`
- `TC_MDNS_ADVERTISE_AFP`
- `TC_ANY_PROTOCOL`
- `TC_REQUIRE_SMB_ENCRYPTION`
- `TC_FORCE_DISABLE_SMB_SIGNING_AND_ENCRYPTION`
- `TC_FRUIT_METADATA_NETATALK`
- `TC_VFS_AIO_FORK_ENABLED`
- `TC_DEBUG_LOGGING`
- `TC_ATA_IDLE_SECONDS`
- `TC_ATA_STANDBY`
- `TC_CONFIGURE_ID`

Current `.bootstrap` values include:
- `INSTALL_ID`
- optional `TELEMETRY=false`

## macOS App Advanced Checkboxes

The Advanced panel stores these choices in the local device profile. Run **Install / Update Samba** afterward to write the corresponding runtime values to `/mnt/Flash/tcapsulesmb.conf`; changing a checkbox alone does not reconfigure the device. The defaults below are new-profile defaults, not necessarily the checked state shown for an existing saved profile.

### Enable NBNS

Default: on. Enables `NBNS_ENABLED=1`, causing the manager to stage `nbns-advertiser` into RAM and answer IPv4 NetBIOS name and node-status queries on UDP `137`. The responder uses the same LAN-owner interface selection as LAN-only Samba and does not answer through WAN links. This helps older Windows-style discovery; Bonjour-capable clients do not require it.

### Enable rsync

Default: off. Enables `RSYNC_ENABLED=1`, causing the manager to stage the bundled daemon into RAM and expose a writable `shareroot` module on TCP `873`, running as Unix `root:wheel`. The generated rsync configuration has no rsync authentication block, so enable this only on a trusted LAN; **Bind SMB to LAN Only** does not restrict the separate rsync daemon.

### Internal Share Uses Disk Root

Default: off. When off, an internal disk share points at `/Volumes/dkN/ShareRoot`; when on, it exposes the whole `/Volumes/dkN` root instead. External disks always use their volume root, and the `.samba4` payload remains hidden from SMB clients through the share veto rule.

### Bind SMB to LAN Only

Default: off. When enabled, Samba selects LAN-owner interfaces such as bridge, `br`, or `lan` interfaces, with a private-LAN fallback, instead of binding every eligible non-loopback SMB address. This reduces exposure on WAN or tunnel interfaces, but clients outside the selected LAN may no longer reach SMB and Doctor will report that route mismatch.

### Allow SMB Share Browsing

Default: off. Changes Samba's global `restrict anonymous` value from `2` to `0` so clients that need anonymous browse enumeration can list the server's shares. It does not enable guest file access: shares still use `guest ok = no`, require authentication, and map authenticated users to Unix `root`.

### Advertise AFP over Bonjour

Default: off. Adds a generated `_afpovertcp._tcp` record on port `548` and changes generated ADISK flags from SMB-only `adVF=0x82` to AFP+SMB `adVF=0x83`. This only changes managed Bonjour advertisement; it does not configure or authenticate an AFP server.

Managed Bonjour records are link-scoped. LAN-owner links receive the complete generated service set. Other addressed links receive only the `_airport._tcp` service and the host-address records it needs for AirPort Utility discovery; SMB, AFP, ADISK, device-info, printer, and unknown captured services are not published there. The runtime identifies routed WAN links from the active PF NAT egress plus IPv4 and IPv6 default routes, then maps those interfaces back to live `ifconfig` addresses when NetBSD 4 omits `getifaddrs` owner names. NetBSD's embedded link-local IPv6 scope is retained for local Samba binding but removed from DNS AAAA records. If routing evidence is unavailable, the runtime preserves the prior fail-open private-address fallback rather than disabling working LAN discovery.

### Use Netatalk for metadata

Default: on. Selects `fruit:metadata = netatalk`, the Netatalk-compatible metadata format used by Samba's `fruit` module. Turning it off selects `fruit:metadata = stream`; changing this for existing files should be treated as a metadata-compatibility decision rather than a performance toggle.

### Force Debug Logging

Default: off. Enables `SMBD_DEBUG_LOGGING=1` and `MDNS_DEBUG_LOGGING=1`, sets Samba to `log level = 10`, and removes the normal managed payload-log size cap. Use it only while troubleshooting because verbose unbounded logs can grow on the disk and add overhead.

### Enable vfs_aio_fork

Default: off. Adds the bounded `aio_fork` VFS module, enables asynchronous I/O for requests of at least one byte, limits SMB2 reads and writes to `128 KiB`, and caps each share at eight forked workers. It is an optional no-pthread I/O profile; leave it off unless testing shows it helps the target workload.

### Allow Any SMB Protocol

Default: off. Omits the generated SMB2-to-SMB3 minimum/maximum protocol lines and leaves protocol selection to Samba's built-in defaults. It is a compatibility escape hatch, not a promise that every historical SMB dialect is available, and it cannot be combined with **Require SMB Encryption**.

### Require SMB Encryption

Default: off. Writes `server smb encrypt = required`, `server min protocol = SMB3_00`, and `server max protocol = SMB3`, so clients must negotiate encrypted SMB3. The app disables **Allow Any SMB Protocol** and **Force Disable SMB Signing and Encryption** when this option is selected.

### Force Disable SMB Signing and Encryption

Default: off. Writes `server signing = disabled` and `server smb encrypt = off`. This may improve throughput when a client would otherwise require signing, but it weakens SMB transport security and cannot be combined with **Require SMB Encryption**.

## CLI Command Reference

The CLI entrypoint is `tcapsule COMMAND [ARGS...]`. In a normal checkout the first command is usually run through the repo-local launcher:

```bash
./tcapsule bootstrap
```

After bootstrap, use the virtualenv command:

```bash
.venv/bin/tcapsule <command>
```

The top-level command dispatcher supports:
- `activate`
- `api`
- `bootstrap`
- `configure`
- `deploy`
- `discover`
- `doctor`
- `flash`
- `fsck`
- `paths`
- `repair-xattrs`
- `set-ssh`
- `uninstall`
- `validate-install`

Shared command behavior:
- all commands except `api` perform the client version check before running, unless the invocation is only asking for `-h` or `--help`
- commands that read the device config accept `--config PATH`, which overrides `TCAPSULE_CONFIG` and the repo-local `.env`
- commands that can prompt usually accept `--no-input`; in that mode they fail instead of asking for missing input or confirmation
- commands that can make destructive or rebooting changes use `--yes` to skip confirmation in interactive and non-interactive runs
- commands with `--json` do not all use the same output shape; most command JSON is a single final object, while `repair-xattrs --json` emits app-event NDJSON
- for commands where JSON describes a plan, `--json` is intentionally restricted to `--dry-run`

### `bootstrap`

`tcapsule bootstrap` prepares the local host. It validates the selected Python, creates or reuses `.venv`, installs `requirements.txt`, installs the repo into the virtualenv, and verifies required host tools. If `smbclient` or `sshpass` is missing, it attempts host-tool installation through Homebrew on supported macOS versions or through the detected Linux package manager.

Arguments:
- `--python PYTHON`: Python interpreter validated and used when creating a new `.venv`; defaults to the Python running the command. An existing `.venv` is reused with its existing interpreter. The selected interpreter must be Python 3.9 or newer.

This command does not read `.env` for device credentials, but it does create or preserve the local install identity in `.bootstrap`.

### `paths`

`tcapsule paths` resolves the local TimeCapsuleSMB paths and prints the distribution root, config path, state dir, package root, artifact manifest, and deployable artifacts with basic validity status. It is useful when debugging an install that may have been moved, wrapped, or invoked from a different working directory.

Arguments:
- `--config PATH`: resolve paths as though this config file were selected
- `--json`: emit the same path and artifact data as JSON

### `validate-install`

`tcapsule validate-install` checks the repo-only install without touching the device. It validates the local distribution root, state/config path resolution, packaged files, and artifact metadata expected by the app and CLI.

Arguments:
- `--config PATH`: validate using the selected config path for local path resolution
- `--json`: emit `{ "ok": ..., "checks": ... }` and return nonzero if validation fails

### `discover`

`tcapsule discover` browses Bonjour/mDNS for Apple AirPort storage services and prints both raw browse instances and resolved service records. Discovery uses Python zeroconf, not native `dns-sd`, so it remains usable on Linux and in non-macOS diagnostics.

Arguments:
- `--config PATH`: load optional config for telemetry context only; discovery itself does not require `.env`
- `--timeout SECONDS`: Bonjour browse timeout; default is `6`
- `--json`: emit discovered instances and resolved records as JSON
- `--select`: after printing records, prompt for a device number and print only the selected display host

### `configure`

`tcapsule configure` creates or updates `.env`. In interactive mode it attempts AirPort Bonjour discovery, prompts for the SSH target and device password, checks SSH reachability, enables SSH through ACP when needed, probes the device, derives identity/config defaults, and writes the managed config. The password is stored as `TC_PASSWORD` for host-side SSH/ACP access; Samba auth is generated on the device at boot from live AirPort `syPW`.

Arguments:
- `--config PATH`: write/read this config path instead of the default `.env`
- `--no-input`: do not prompt; requires enough arguments or existing config to proceed
- `--password-env NAME`: read the device password from environment variable `NAME`
- `--password-file PATH`: read the device password from a file, stripping trailing newlines
- `--password-stdin`: read the device password from stdin, stripping trailing newlines
- `--host HOST`: set the device SSH target, for example `root@192.168.1.10`; custom SSH ports are rejected here and should be placed in `TC_SSH_OPTS`
- `--skip-discovery`: skip Bonjour discovery and use the supplied or saved SSH target
- `--yes`: approve ACP SSH enablement when SSH is closed
- `--enable-ssh`: enable SSH via ACP if SSH is closed
- `--no-enable-ssh`: fail instead of enabling SSH via ACP if SSH is closed
- `--json`: emit a machine-readable result; requires `--no-input`

Hidden advanced arguments:
- `--internal-share-use-disk-root` / `--no-internal-share-use-disk-root`: write `TC_INTERNAL_SHARE_USE_DISK_ROOT=true|false`
- `--smb-bind-lan-only` / `--no-smb-bind-lan-only`: write `TC_SMB_BIND_LAN_ONLY=true|false`
- `--smb-browse-compatibility` / `--no-smb-browse-compatibility`: write `TC_SMB_BROWSE_COMPATIBILITY=true|false`
- `--mdns-advertise-afp` / `--no-mdns-advertise-afp`: write `TC_MDNS_ADVERTISE_AFP=true|false`
- `--any-protocol` / `--no-any-protocol`: write `TC_ANY_PROTOCOL=true|false`
- `--require-smb-encryption` / `--no-require-smb-encryption`: write `TC_REQUIRE_SMB_ENCRYPTION=true|false`
- `--force-disable-smb-signing-and-encryption` / `--no-force-disable-smb-signing-and-encryption`: write `TC_FORCE_DISABLE_SMB_SIGNING_AND_ENCRYPTION=true|false`; `--disable-smb-security` and `--no-disable-smb-security` are aliases
- `--netatalk` / `--no-netatalk`: write `TC_FRUIT_METADATA_NETATALK=true|false`
- `--enable-vfs-aio-fork` / `--disable-vfs-aio-fork`: writes `TC_VFS_AIO_FORK_ENABLED=true|false`; toggles the bounded `vfs_aio_fork` runtime profile
- `--debug-logging` / `--no-debug-logging`: explicitly enable or disable managed runtime debug logging
- `--ata-idle-seconds SECONDS`: writes `TC_ATA_IDLE_SECONDS`; must be a non-negative integer, with `0` disabling the ATA idle timer
- `--ata-standby SECONDS`: writes `TC_ATA_STANDBY`; must be a non-negative integer, with `0` disabling standby and a blank saved value leaving standby unchanged

`TC_ANY_PROTOCOL=true` cannot be combined with `TC_REQUIRE_SMB_ENCRYPTION=true`. Required encryption also cannot be combined with `TC_FORCE_DISABLE_SMB_SIGNING_AND_ENCRYPTION=true`; configure rejects either conflict before writing `.env`.

Non-interactive examples:

```bash
TC_PASS='airport-password' .venv/bin/tcapsule configure --no-input --host root@192.168.1.10 --password-env TC_PASS --enable-ssh --yes
printf '%s\n' 'airport-password' | .venv/bin/tcapsule configure --no-input --host root@192.168.1.10 --password-stdin --json
```

### `set-ssh`

`tcapsule set-ssh` is an advanced helper for toggling the firmware SSH debug flag. It uses the configured target from `.env`. If no explicit mode is selected, it preserves the older behavior: enable SSH when closed, or ask whether to disable it when already open.

Arguments:
- `--config PATH`: use a non-default config
- `--enable`: enable SSH via ACP if port 22 is closed; no-op if already open
- `--disable`: remove the `dbug` property over SSH and reboot; no-op if SSH is already closed
- `--status`: only report whether SSH port 22 is reachable; cannot be combined with `--no-wait`
- `--yes`: skip the legacy prompt when SSH is already enabled and no explicit mode was selected
- `--no-input`: fail instead of prompting in legacy mode
- `--no-wait`: after enabling or disabling, return without waiting for the port/reboot verification

Use `configure` for normal first-time setup. Use `set-ssh` only when you intentionally want to manage SSH separately from the main config flow.

### `deploy`

`tcapsule deploy` installs or updates the managed Samba payload on the configured device. It validates the local artifacts, probes device compatibility, selects a writable HFS payload volume, uploads the payload and boot files, writes `/mnt/Flash/tcapsulesmb.conf`, installs the scripts and configuration that generate Samba auth files in RAM during boot or activation, applies permissions, and reboots by default. On NetBSD 4 devices, deploy checks the runtime after SSH returns and activates it only when firmware startup has not already done so.

Arguments:
- `--config PATH`: use a non-default config
- `--no-reboot`: upload files, stop the current runtime, and activate the new runtime in place without rebooting
- `--no-wait`: request reboot and return without waiting for SSH or runtime verification
- `--yes`: do not prompt before reboot
- `--no-input`: fail instead of prompting; non-dry-run rebooting deploys require `--yes` unless `--no-reboot` is used
- `--dry-run`: build and print the deployment plan without changing the device
- `--json`: emit the dry-run deployment plan as JSON; requires `--dry-run`
- `--allow-unsupported`: continue when the detected device compatibility check is unsupported
- `--no-nbns`: write `NBNS_ENABLED=0` so the bundled NBNS responder is disabled on the next boot
- `--enable-rsync`: write `RSYNC_ENABLED=1` so the manager stages and starts the bundled rsync daemon from RAM; the binary and config are uploaded even when this flag is omitted
- `--mount-wait SECONDS`: per-attempt wait for deployment-time `diskd.useVolume` mount guards; default is `30`

Hidden advanced arguments:
- persisted profile settings accept positive/negative overrides for internal-share root, SMB LAN binding/browsing, AFP advertising, protocol/security choices, Netatalk metadata, debug logging, and `vfs_aio_fork`; omitting a pair preserves the saved `.env` value
- `--debug-logging` / `--no-debug-logging`: override saved debug logging for this deploy; enabling increases runtime logging and disables the normal managed log size cap
- `--enable-vfs-aio-fork` / `--disable-vfs-aio-fork`: override the saved bounded `vfs_aio_fork` setting for this deployment

Useful plan modes:

```bash
.venv/bin/tcapsule deploy --dry-run
.venv/bin/tcapsule deploy --dry-run --json
```

### `activate`

`tcapsule activate` manually starts an already-deployed NetBSD 4 payload without uploading files again. It is intentionally conservative: if the managed runtime already appears active, or a managed startup script is already running, it skips re-running `/mnt/Flash/rc.local`.

Arguments:
- `--config PATH`: use a non-default config
- `--yes`: do not prompt before restarting deployed Samba services
- `--no-input`: fail instead of prompting; non-dry-run activation requires `--yes`
- `--dry-run`: print the activation actions without changing the device
- `--json`: emit the dry-run activation plan as JSON; requires `--dry-run`

This command is only supported for NetBSD 4 AirPort storage devices. NetBSD 6 devices should use `deploy` for persistent installs and normal updates.

### `flash`

`tcapsule flash` is the NetBSD 4 firmware-bank helper. By default it is read-only: it backs up and analyzes both flash banks, saves a manifest, and prints the firmware state. Write modes are explicit. `--patch` installs the persistent TimeCapsuleSMB boot hook into the primary bank. `--restore` writes Apple stock firmware to the uniquely selected active bank, or to the primary bank with a warning when both candidates pass active selection.

Arguments:
- `--config PATH`: use a non-default config
- `--read-only`: dump and back up firmware banks without patch planning; this is also the default when no mode is provided
- `--patch`: build and write the TimeCapsuleSMB LOGIN hook patch to the primary bank
- `--restore`: restore the selected candidate bank from Apple stock firmware; when both candidates pass active selection, target the primary bank
- `--check-apple`: check whether the candidate bank or banks match Apple stock firmware
- `--download-only`: connect to the configured NetBSD 4 device, back up and analyze its banks, then download and validate Apple firmware without writing firmware
- `--yes`: do not prompt before `--patch` or `--restore` writes; only valid for write modes
- `--no-input`: fail instead of prompting; write modes require `--yes`
- `--reboot`: after a validated `--restore` write, request a software reboot
- `--no-wait`: with `--restore --reboot`, return after the reboot request without waiting for the device
- `--json`: emit flash analysis and plan JSON; only valid for read-only modes, not `--patch` or `--restore`
- `--backup-dir PATH`: use `PATH` as this run's exact backup directory instead of creating a timestamped directory under the default backup root
- `--force`: with `--patch`, bypass backup/active-candidate preflight and target the primary bank
- `--firmware-template PATH`: use a local Apple `.basebinary` firmware template instead of auto-selecting from Apple's catalog
- `--firmware-version VERSION`: select an Apple firmware version, for example `7.8.1`

Hidden unsupported argument:
- `--poweroff`: currently rejected with an error; patch mode requires a manual power cycle after a validated write

Important mode restrictions:
- `flash --patch --reboot` is rejected; patch mode cannot request a software reboot
- `--reboot` is only valid with `--restore`
- `--no-wait` is only valid with `--restore --reboot`
- `--json` is only valid for read-only flash modes
- patch mode requires `zopfli` gzip support on the host

### `doctor`

`tcapsule doctor` runs local and remote diagnostics without deploying, rebooting, or changing managed configuration. It validates config and local tools, checks artifact presence and checksums, probes SSH/network/runtime state, checks Bonjour and NBNS visibility, runs authenticated SMB listing and temporary CRUD checks, and verifies that Samba xattr state points at persistent storage.

Arguments:
- `--config PATH`: use a non-default config
- `--skip-ssh`: skip SSH reachability and remote checks
- `--skip-bonjour`: skip Bonjour browse/resolve checks
- `--skip-smb`: skip authenticated SMB listing and file-operation checks
- `--no-startup-grace`: show raw startup-window failures instead of collapsing eligible transient failures into one wait-and-retry result
- `--json`: emit one structured final doctor payload

`doctor` is the preferred post-deploy and post-reboot verification command. Its default SMB CRUD checks temporarily create, modify, and remove a hidden `.doctor-fileops-*` directory on a share. A timeout, interruption, or early failure can leave that directory behind; use `--skip-smb` when the diagnostic run must not write through SMB.

### `fsck`

`tcapsule fsck` runs remote `fsck_hfs` against a mounted HFS volume. It mounts/wakes the Apple volumes, selects or prompts for a volume, stops file sharing through the generated remote script, unmounts the selected disk, runs `fsck_hfs`, and reboots by default.

Arguments:
- `--config PATH`: use a non-default config
- `--yes`: do not prompt before disk repair
- `--no-input`: fail instead of prompting; repair requires `--yes`
- `--no-reboot`: run `fsck_hfs` only and do not reboot afterward
- `--no-wait`: when rebooting, do not wait for SSH to go down and come back
- `--volume VOLUME`: select the HFS volume device, for example `dk2` or `/dev/dk2`; if omitted and multiple mounted volumes exist, interactive mode prompts

Use this only when the disk needs repair before deploy or when doctor/troubleshooting points at filesystem problems.

### `repair-xattrs`

`tcapsule repair-xattrs` is a macOS-side mounted-share repair helper. It scans files and directories on a local SMB mount, diagnoses broken extended-attribute metadata, and safely repairs the known case where `xattr -l` fails and the macOS `arch` flag is present by clearing that flag. Other metadata failures are reported without being treated as the same repair case. It is a targeted cleanup tool, not a general metadata migration.

Arguments:
- `--config PATH`: use a non-default config when auto-detecting the mounted share
- `--path PATH`: mounted SMB share path or subdirectory to scan; if omitted, the command tries to find the mounted SMB share matching `.env`
- `--dry-run`: scan and report only; do not prompt or repair
- `--yes`: repair without prompting
- `--no-input`: do not prompt; use with `--dry-run` or `--yes`
- `--recursive`: scan recursively; enabled by default
- `--no-recursive`: scan only the top-level directory
- `--max-depth DEPTH`: maximum recursive directory depth; must be non-negative
- `--include-hidden`: include hidden dot paths that are normally skipped
- `--include-time-machine`: include Time Machine and bundle-like paths that are normally skipped
- `--fix-permissions`: additionally apply `ugo+rw` to files or `ugo+rwx` to directories that do not already have all corresponding permission bits
- `--verbose`: print detailed diagnostics for detected issues
- `--json`: emit app-event NDJSON; when not using `--dry-run`, this requires `--yes`

Argument restrictions:
- `--dry-run` and `--yes` are mutually exclusive
- `--max-depth` must be non-negative
- the command must run on macOS because it depends on local `xattr` and `chflags`

### `uninstall`

`tcapsule uninstall` removes managed TimeCapsuleSMB files from the configured device. It stops the manager, removes the payload directories from mounted HFS volumes, removes loader files under `/mnt/Flash` and runtime state, and reboots by default so Apple services and the root filesystem return to their clean state. After a waited reboot it verifies that managed files are gone. It does not restore a firmware bank changed by `flash --patch`; use `flash --restore` for that separate operation.

Arguments:
- `--config PATH`: use a non-default config
- `--mount-wait SECONDS`: wait for `diskd.useVolume` mount guards before manual fallback; default is `30`
- `--no-wait`: request reboot and return without waiting for post-uninstall verification
- `--yes`: do not prompt before reboot
- `--no-input`: fail instead of prompting; non-dry-run rebooting uninstalls require `--yes` unless `--no-reboot` is used
- `--no-reboot`: remove files but do not reboot the device
- `--dry-run`: print the uninstall plan without changing the device
- `--json`: emit the dry-run uninstall plan as JSON; requires `--dry-run`

`uninstall` does not re-enable Apple AFP or SMB settings or restore a patched firmware bank; it only removes TimeCapsuleSMB-managed files and runtime state.

### `api`

`tcapsule api` is the structured backend used by the macOS app. It reads one JSON object from stdin, runs the requested operation, and writes app-event NDJSON to stdout. The request must be a JSON object with:
- `operation`: required operation name
- `params`: optional JSON object; defaults to `{}`
- `request_id`: optional request identifier echoed on emitted events

Arguments:
- `--pretty-error`: also write request parsing errors to stderr for local debugging

Known public app operations are `activate`, `capabilities`, `configure`, `deploy`, `discover`, `doctor`, `flash`, `fsck`, `reachability`, `repair-xattrs`, `set-ssh`, `set-telemetry`, `uninstall`, `validate-install`, and `version-check`. The backend also accepts internal non-public operations such as `update-config-settings`. This is not the normal human CLI surface; prefer the direct commands above unless you are integrating with the GUI helper contract.

## Local Test Coverage

`make install` installs `coverage.py` through the `dev` optional dependency. `./tcapsule bootstrap` installs `requirements.txt` and the normal editable package, but does not install the development-only coverage dependency.

Test and coverage entry points:
- `make test` runs C compile checks plus the pytest suite
- `make test-parallel` runs the same C compile checks and the pytest suite through `pytest-xdist`
- `make coverage` runs the pytest suite with branch coverage and prints missing source lines
- `make coverage-html` writes the browsable report to `htmlcov/index.html`
- `make coverage-native` reports native C coverage; see [native checks](build/native/README.md#builds-and-checks)
- `cd macos/TimeCapsuleSMB && swift test` runs the macOS app/helper unit tests; the package supplies the Xcode platform framework search path needed for XCTest/Swift Testing imports

The root `make test` targets do not run the Swift suite; run both the Python/C and Swift entry points when a change crosses the backend/app boundary.

Optional deploy flag:
- `--no-nbns`
  - disables the bundled NBNS responder on the next boot by writing `NBNS_ENABLED=0` to `/mnt/Flash/tcapsulesmb.conf`

Current defaults and fixed values:
- `TC_INTERNAL_SHARE_USE_DISK_ROOT=false`
- `TC_SMB_BIND_LAN_ONLY=false`
- `TC_SMB_BROWSE_COMPATIBILITY=false`
- `TC_MDNS_ADVERTISE_AFP=false`
- `TC_ANY_PROTOCOL=false`
- `TC_REQUIRE_SMB_ENCRYPTION=false`
- `TC_FORCE_DISABLE_SMB_SIGNING_AND_ENCRYPTION=false`
- `TC_FRUIT_METADATA_NETATALK=true`
- `TC_VFS_AIO_FORK_ENABLED=false`
- `TC_DEBUG_LOGGING=false`
- `TC_ATA_IDLE_SECONDS=300`
- `TC_ATA_STANDBY=` leaves the standby timer unchanged; set `0` to disable standby
- `TC_SSH_OPTS` includes the legacy SSH algorithms required by AirPort firmware
- docs and examples use SMB username `admin`
- the managed payload directory is fixed at `.samba4`

Samba NetBIOS, Samba server string, Bonjour instance, and Bonjour host labels are derived on the device at runtime from `/usr/bin/acp -q syNm` and `/bin/hostname`; they are not configured in `.env`.

Current validation behavior:
- `TC_HOST`: must be non-empty.
- `TC_PASSWORD`: Doctor, flash, and non-status `set-ssh` operations require a configured value; deploy and activate can prompt interactively when it is absent, while fsck and uninstall allow passwordless SSH key/agent authentication.
- `TC_SSH_OPTS`: is written by `configure` with the legacy SSH options needed for AirPort firmware.
- the managed share, binding, browsing, AFP, protocol/security, Netatalk metadata, `vfs_aio_fork`, and debug settings listed above must contain recognized boolean values.
- `TC_INTERNAL_SHARE_USE_DISK_ROOT`: internal disks use `ShareRoot` by default, and external disks always use the disk root.
- the protocol/security validator rejects required encryption combined with either `TC_ANY_PROTOCOL=true` or `TC_FORCE_DISABLE_SMB_SIGNING_AND_ENCRYPTION=true`.
- `TC_ATA_IDLE_SECONDS`: optional non-negative integer; default `300`, and `0` disables the ATA idle timer through `atactl setidle 0`.
- `TC_ATA_STANDBY`: optional non-negative integer; blank leaves standby unchanged, and `0` disables standby through `atactl setstandby 0`.
- `TC_CONFIGURE_ID`: is a local configuration revision ID and is not user-validated.

Workflow details:
- `configure` now starts by attempting mDNS discovery of the Time Capsule on the local network
- if SSH is already reachable, `configure` validates the SSH target/password and then probes the device directly
- if SSH is closed, `configure` enables SSH with the built-in Python 3 ACP client, reboots the device through ACP, waits for SSH to come back, and then probes the device directly
- ACP authentication failures during `configure` reprompt for the Time Capsule password; non-authentication ACP failures stop configuration with the underlying error
- `configure` uses discovered and probed Apple identity metadata to classify compatibility and present device details, but it does not persist model or `syAP` hints in managed `.env`
- for NetBSD 4 devices, the probe/compatibility layer uses endianness and on-device `acp` identity data to classify the exact generation when possible
- `configure` validates managed `.env` inputs before writing `.env`
- `deploy`, `activate`, and `doctor` fail early when managed `.env` config values are invalid
- the command entrypoints live under [src/timecapsulesmb/cli/](src/timecapsulesmb/cli)
- reusable workflows live under [src/timecapsulesmb/services/](src/timecapsulesmb/services), with deployment plans/execution under [src/timecapsulesmb/deploy/](src/timecapsulesmb/deploy) and device probes/state under [src/timecapsulesmb/device/](src/timecapsulesmb/device)
- the checked-in binaries and build tooling are visible in the repo, so advanced users can swap binaries, rebuild artifacts, or trace the exact boot/runtime layout

## Host-Side Architecture

Current important package areas:
- [src/timecapsulesmb/cli/](src/timecapsulesmb/cli): command entrypoints for `bootstrap`, `paths`, `validate-install`, `discover`, `configure`, `set-ssh`, `deploy`, `flash`, `activate`, `doctor`, `fsck`, `repair-xattrs`, `uninstall`, and the app-facing `api` helper
- [src/timecapsulesmb/app/](src/timecapsulesmb/app): structured API request handling, operation contracts, progress/result events, confirmations, recovery guidance, and app-specific operation adapters
- [src/timecapsulesmb/services/](src/timecapsulesmb/services): reusable configure, deploy, activation, maintenance, storage, reboot, Doctor, and runtime workflows shared by the CLI and app/API entrypoints
- [src/timecapsulesmb/core/](src/timecapsulesmb/core): shared config parsing, defaults, and common models
- [src/timecapsulesmb/transport/](src/timecapsulesmb/transport): local command execution plus SSH and SCP helpers
- [src/timecapsulesmb/discovery/](src/timecapsulesmb/discovery): Bonjour-based device discovery
- [src/timecapsulesmb/integrations/](src/timecapsulesmb/integrations): self-contained Python 3 ACP client for SSH enable/reboot support
- [src/timecapsulesmb/checks/](src/timecapsulesmb/checks): reusable local, network, Bonjour, and SMB verification checks
- [src/timecapsulesmb/device/](src/timecapsulesmb/device): remote probing for device-specific layout, `MaSt` volume parsing, payload-home selection, plus generation / compatibility classification
- [src/timecapsulesmb/deploy/](src/timecapsulesmb/deploy): deployment planning, remote actions, upload execution, dry-run formatting, artifact resolution, and post-deploy verification
- [src/timecapsulesmb/assets/](src/timecapsulesmb/assets): packaged boot templates and artifact metadata
- [src/timecapsulesmb/identity.py](src/timecapsulesmb/identity.py): local install identity loaded from `.bootstrap`
- [src/timecapsulesmb/telemetry/](src/timecapsulesmb/telemetry): best-effort client telemetry for user-facing commands
- [macos/TimeCapsuleSMB/](macos/TimeCapsuleSMB): the Swift macOS app, helper launcher, saved device profiles, workflow stores, localized UI, and Swift tests
- [build/](build): maintainer build tooling, including Samba cross-exec record/replay helpers

Developer note:
- [src/timecapsulesmb/cli/context.py](src/timecapsulesmb/cli/context.py) owns shared per-command lifecycle state such as timing, command IDs, result state, and finish handling.
- [src/timecapsulesmb/services/runtime.py](src/timecapsulesmb/services/runtime.py) owns shared `.env` loading, SSH connection resolution, managed-target validation, and compatibility probing; [src/timecapsulesmb/cli/runtime.py](src/timecapsulesmb/cli/runtime.py) provides CLI argument, prompting, rendering, and compatibility-display helpers.
- Normal users should not need these details; they mostly keep command entrypoints smaller and more consistent.

Practical consequence:
- if you want to modify how the box is discovered, start in `discovery/`
- if you want to change shared install behavior, start in `services/deploy.py`; for the action plan and transfer mechanics, inspect `deploy/planner.py` and `deploy/executor.py`
- if you want to change the app contract or progress events, start in `app/` and then follow the matching shared service
- if you want to change the on-device boot behavior, inspect the packaged boot assets and the runtime layout sections below
- if you want to replace binaries or rebuild them, inspect the artifact manifest plus the `build/` tree

## Doctor Command

[src/timecapsulesmb/cli/doctor.py](src/timecapsulesmb/cli/doctor.py) is a local diagnostic helper that does not deploy, reboot, or change managed configuration.

It checks:
- `.env` completeness and invalid `.env` values
- required local tools
- whether the required checked-in binaries exist and match the expected checksums
- deployed release/version metadata in `/mnt/Flash/tcapsulesmb.conf`
- that the managed RAM runtime directory exists
- SSH reachability
- detected device compatibility and payload family
- managed `smbd`, mDNS takeover, and enabled/disabled rsync readiness
- active Samba version, RAM-staged binary/config/auth paths, manager state, mounted share volumes, and required service sockets
- remote IPv4/IPv6 capabilities, current bind interfaces, local routes to advertised addresses, and family-specific direct SMB reachability
- advertised Bonjour instance name
- advertised Bonjour host label
- `_smb._tcp`, `_adisk._tcp`, `_device-info._tcp`, and `_airport._tcp` target consistency for the active instance
- `_adisk._tcp` Time Machine flags, advertised disk rows, active share coverage, and target-host agreement with `_smb._tcp`
- that advertised host addresses match the reachable runtime target
- active Samba NetBIOS name
- active Samba share names
- SMB reachability
- `_smb._tcp` browse and resolve
- NBNS name resolution unless `/mnt/Flash/tcapsulesmb.conf` has `NBNS_ENABLED=0`
- authenticated `smbclient -L` listing
- authenticated SMB CRUD operations via `smbclient`
- that at least one active Samba share is present in the authenticated SMB listing
- that the active runtime `xattr_tdb:file` path in `/mnt/Memory/samba4/etc/smb.conf` points at persistent storage instead of the ramdisk

It does not:
- deploy
- reboot
- change managed device configuration

Its authenticated SMB CRUD checks do temporarily write to a share. They normally remove their hidden `.doctor-fileops-*` test directory, but an interruption, timeout, or early failure can leave it behind. Use `--skip-smb` when the diagnostic run must not perform SMB writes.

Current output behavior:
- in normal human-readable mode, checks are printed as they complete rather than being buffered until the end
- `--json` still emits one structured payload at the end
- during the first `180` seconds after the manager starts, eligible transient startup failures are demoted to context and replaced by one actionable wait-and-retry failure; `--no-startup-grace` disables that transformation

Typical usage:

```bash
.venv/bin/tcapsule doctor
```

Machine-readable output:

```bash
.venv/bin/tcapsule doctor --json
```

Optional skips:

```bash
.venv/bin/tcapsule doctor --skip-ssh
.venv/bin/tcapsule doctor --skip-bonjour
.venv/bin/tcapsule doctor --skip-smb
```

The normal goal is to use it as a quick health check after:
- local setup
- deploy
- reboot

Current doctor caveats:
- for SSH-proxied targets, `doctor` now creates a temporary local SMB tunnel and runs the authenticated SMB checks through that forwarded port
- the xattr persistence check inspects the active runtime config under `/mnt/Memory/samba4`, not the persistent template on disk

## Repair Xattrs Command

[src/timecapsulesmb/cli/repair_xattrs.py](src/timecapsulesmb/cli/repair_xattrs.py) is a macOS-side repair and diagnostic helper for files and directories whose SMB extended-attribute metadata became unreadable.

This was added after observing files on the mounted Samba share where:
- normal POSIX permissions looked fine
- TextEdit could open the file but could not save it back in place
- `xattr -l <file>` failed with `Invalid argument`
- `ls -lO@ <file>` showed the macOS `arch` file flag

The automatic xattr repair is intentionally narrow. The command scans files and directories, reports broader xattr and file-data failures, and automatically clears the `arch` flag only when `xattr -l` fails and that flag is present:

```bash
chflags noarch <file>
```

Typical scan-and-prompt usage:

```bash
.venv/bin/tcapsule repair-xattrs --path /Volumes/<share-name>
```

When exactly one matching `smbfs` mount is visible locally, `--path` can usually be omitted. The command reads the local `mount` table and matches mounted SMB volumes to the configured `TC_HOST`. If more than one candidate is mounted, pass `--path` explicitly:

```bash
.venv/bin/tcapsule repair-xattrs
```

Useful modes:

```bash
.venv/bin/tcapsule repair-xattrs --path /Volumes/<share-name> --dry-run
.venv/bin/tcapsule repair-xattrs --path /Volumes/<share-name> --yes
.venv/bin/tcapsule repair-xattrs --path /Volumes/<share-name>/some-folder --no-recursive
.venv/bin/tcapsule repair-xattrs --path /Volumes/<share-name> --max-depth 2
```

Default safety behavior:
- prompts before changing files unless `--yes` is passed
- verifies file size is unchanged after repair
- verifies `xattr -l` succeeds after repair
- skips symlinks
- skips hidden dot paths unless `--include-hidden` is passed
- skips Time Machine and bundle-like paths unless `--include-time-machine` is passed
- when `--fix-permissions` is selected, adds `ugo+rw` to affected files or `ugo+rwx` to affected directories

This command should be treated as a targeted cleanup tool for user files, not as a general metadata migration command. Do not run it over Time Machine backup bundles unless you are deliberately investigating that path.

## Deploy Details

[src/timecapsulesmb/cli/deploy.py](src/timecapsulesmb/cli/deploy.py) is now mostly an orchestrator over shared modules in [src/timecapsulesmb/deploy/](src/timecapsulesmb/deploy) and [src/timecapsulesmb/device/](src/timecapsulesmb/device).

Current deploy flow:

- loads `.env`
- validates the managed config before touching the device
- validates the required binary artifacts against the artifact manifest
- probes device compatibility and rejects unsupported targets before upload
- reads Apple `MaSt` disk metadata from the device
- selects exactly one writable persistent payload home:
  - first writable internal `builtin=true` HFS volume
  - else first writable external HFS volume
  - else fails with `no writable persistent volume found`
- computes the device-specific runtime and payload paths from that payload home
- builds a deployment plan before execution
- creates the persistent payload dir under `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4`
- uploads the checked-in binaries:
  - `smbd`
  - `mdns-advertiser`
  - `nbns-advertiser`
  - `service`
  - `telemetry`
  - `rsync`
- generates and uploads the persistent rsync daemon configuration:
  - `/Volumes/dkX/.samba4/rsyncd.conf`
- renders and uploads the packaged boot/runtime files:
  - `rc.local`
  - `common.sh`
  - `boot.sh`
  - `manager.sh`
  - `dfree.sh`
- generates and uploads flash runtime config:
  - `/mnt/Flash/tcapsulesmb.conf`
- does not upload password-derived Samba auth files; runtime staging generates RAM auth from live AirPort `syPW`
- enables NBNS by default:
  - `NBNS_ENABLED=1` in flash config unless `--no-nbns` is used
- disables rsync by default while keeping its HDD payload installed:
  - `RSYNC_ENABLED=0` in flash config unless `--enable-rsync` is used
- applies the required permissions on files and directories
- reboots by default
- if the reboot confirmation is rejected, deploy intentionally stops after upload without activating the runtime so the device can be inspected before a later manual reboot
- verifies managed runtime readiness after reboot:
  - managed `smbd` on TCP `445`
  - managed mDNS takeover on UDP `5353`
  - enabled rsync from RAM on TCP `873`, or disabled rsync with no live daemon
- on NetBSD 4, deploy uploads the NetBSD 4 artifact set, reboots to clear RAM runtime state, waits for SSH to return, and runs `/mnt/Flash/rc.local` only when the firmware has not already started or begun starting the managed runtime

Full Bonjour browse/resolve checks, authenticated SMB listings, SMB CRUD checks, share checks, NBNS checks, xattr persistence checks, and deployed-version checks are handled by `doctor`.

Current compatibility behavior:
- little-endian NetBSD 6 devices are accepted for the current `netbsd6_samba4` payload family
- NetBSD 4 devices use `netbsd4le_samba4` or `netbsd4be_samba4` according to detected ELF endianness
- `configure` reuses the same classification logic for compatibility and displayed device identity

NetBSD 4 activation behavior:
- `tcapsule deploy` uploads the NetBSD 4 payload, reboots, waits for SSH, watches for an already-running `/mnt/Flash/rc.local`, `/mnt/Flash/boot.sh`, or `/mnt/Flash/manager.sh`, runs `/mnt/Flash/rc.local` only if startup is not already in progress, and verifies managed `smbd` plus mDNS takeover
- `tcapsule deploy --no-reboot` uploads the payload, stops the manager plus any legacy watchdog process and `wcifsfs`, runs `/mnt/Flash/rc.local`, and verifies managed `smbd` plus mDNS takeover on both NetBSD 4 and NetBSD 6 devices
- `tcapsule activate` repeats the no-reboot activation sequence without re-uploading files
- Apple `mDNSResponder` takeover is handled inside `mdns-advertiser` during normal generated-advertisement startup
- tested 1st-generation NetBSD 4 hardware without a firmware boot-hook patch does not persist an `/etc` hook and therefore needs manual activation after reboot
- other NetBSD 4 generations may auto-start if their firmware runs `/mnt/Flash/rc.local` early in boot, but that is not yet proven
- `activate` is intentionally conservative: if `smbd` already owns TCP `445` and `mdns-advertiser` already owns UDP `5353`, or if `/mnt/Flash/rc.local`, `/mnt/Flash/boot.sh`, or `/mnt/Flash/manager.sh` is already running, it skips running `/mnt/Flash/rc.local`

The current password flow is:
- `TC_PASSWORD` is retained for app/CLI SSH and ACP access
- runtime staging reads `/usr/bin/acp -q syPW`, generates an NT hash through `service`, and writes RAM-only `smbpasswd`
- no deploy-time password-derived auth file is persisted to the hard disk

This gives a near-enough user experience:
- same password as the current AirPort device password
- password changes made in AirPort Utility are picked up after reboot/runtime staging
- without reverse-engineering Apple’s actual SMB auth backend

Useful operator modes:

```bash
.venv/bin/tcapsule deploy --dry-run
.venv/bin/tcapsule deploy --dry-run --json
.venv/bin/tcapsule activate --dry-run
.venv/bin/tcapsule activate
```

The dry-run modes are intended for users who want to inspect the exact remote actions before touching the box.

Hidden operator mode:
- `tcapsule deploy --debug-logging` writes `SMBD_DEBUG_LOGGING=1` and `MDNS_DEBUG_LOGGING=1` to flash config.
- at runtime, Samba writes `log.smbd` under `<payload>/logs/`, sets `max log size = 0`, and enables `log level = 10`.
- managed runtime logs under `<payload>/logs/` are normally capped around `128 KiB`; `--debug-logging` leaves them unbounded.
- this flag is intentionally not documented in the normal command help because it is for active debugging, not normal installs.

## Client Telemetry

Client telemetry is now emitted by:
- `tcapsule api`
- `tcapsule bootstrap`
- `tcapsule paths`
- `tcapsule validate-install`
- `tcapsule discover`
- `tcapsule configure`
- `tcapsule set-ssh`
- `tcapsule deploy`
- `tcapsule flash`
- `tcapsule activate`
- `tcapsule doctor`
- `tcapsule fsck`
- `tcapsule repair-xattrs`
- `tcapsule uninstall`

Current event model:
- app helper operations emit operation-specific app events through the `api` command
- `bootstrap_started`
- `bootstrap_finished`
- `paths_started`
- `paths_finished`
- `validate_install_started`
- `validate_install_finished`
- `discover_started`
- `discover_finished`
- `configure_started`
- `configure_finished`
- `set_ssh_started`
- `set_ssh_finished`
- `deploy_started`
- `deploy_finished`
- `flash_started`
- `flash_finished`
- `activate_started`
- `activate_finished`
- `doctor_started`
- `doctor_finished`
- `fsck_started`
- `fsck_finished`
- `repair_xattrs_started`
- `repair_xattrs_finished`
- `uninstall_started`
- `uninstall_finished`

Current identity model:
- `.bootstrap` stores a stable local `INSTALL_ID`
- `.env` stores a rotating `TC_CONFIGURE_ID`

Current transport behavior:
- events are sent to the configured HTTPS telemetry endpoint
- started events are sent asynchronously
- finished events are sent synchronously so they are not lost at process exit
- if `.bootstrap` contains `TELEMETRY=false`, telemetry is disabled

## Uninstall

Current uninstall behavior:
- stops the manager first so it cannot restart `smbd` during teardown
- discovers and mounts the current `MaSt` HFS volumes, then removes `.samba4` from every mounted candidate rather than assuming one fixed payload disk
- if no HFS volume is mounted, still removes loader files and runtime state while reporting that only flash/runtime cleanup was possible
- removes loader files under `/mnt/Flash`, the RAM runtime tree, and compatibility symlinks; it does not restore a firmware bank changed by `flash --patch`
- runs remote uninstall actions sequentially over SSH
- prompts before reboot by default
- supports human and JSON dry-run plans, `--mount-wait`, `--no-reboot`, and request-only `--no-wait` reboot behavior
- after a waited reboot, verifies that every planned payload directory, flash loader, RAM path, and compatibility symlink is absent

## Artifact Resolution

The active deployable binaries live in the repo under [bin/](bin).

The host-side code does not hardcode the binary repo paths directly. Artifact path knowledge is centralized in:
- [src/timecapsulesmb/assets/artifact-manifest.json](src/timecapsulesmb/assets/artifact-manifest.json)
- [src/timecapsulesmb/deploy/artifact_resolver.py](src/timecapsulesmb/deploy/artifact_resolver.py)
- [src/timecapsulesmb/deploy/artifacts.py](src/timecapsulesmb/deploy/artifacts.py)

This is useful if you are hacking on the repo because:
- deploy and doctor now resolve artifacts by logical name instead of constructing `bin/...` paths ad hoc
- checksum validation and path resolution happen through one layer
- future work can change where artifacts come from without rewriting deploy and doctor again

## What The Build Pipeline Produces

The build pipeline under [build/](build) is for maintainers, not normal users.

Current important outputs:
- [bin/samba4/smbd](bin/samba4/smbd)
- [bin/samba4-netbsd4le/smbd](bin/samba4-netbsd4le/smbd)
- [bin/samba4-netbsd4be/smbd](bin/samba4-netbsd4be/smbd)
- [bin/mdns/mdns-advertiser](bin/mdns/mdns-advertiser)
- [bin/mdns-netbsd4le/mdns-advertiser](bin/mdns-netbsd4le/mdns-advertiser)

- [bin/rsync-netbsd4le/rsync](bin/rsync-netbsd4le/rsync)
- [bin/rsync-netbsd4be/rsync](bin/rsync-netbsd4be/rsync)

Current active deploy artifact sizes:
- NetBSD 6 `smbd`: about `9.7M`
- NetBSD 6 `mdns-advertiser`: about `299K`
- NetBSD 6 `nbns-advertiser`: about `207K`
- NetBSD 6 `rsync`: about `1.0M`
- NetBSD 4 little-endian `smbd`: about `9.7M`
- NetBSD 4 big-endian `smbd`: about `9.7M`
- NetBSD 4 little-endian `mdns-advertiser`: about `243K`
- NetBSD 4 big-endian `mdns-advertiser`: about `242K`
- NetBSD 4 little-endian `nbns-advertiser`: about `150K`
- NetBSD 4 big-endian `nbns-advertiser`: about `149K`
- NetBSD 4 little-endian `rsync`: about `878K`
- NetBSD 4 big-endian `rsync`: about `872K`

It assumes:
- a NetBSD VM
- root-owned cross-build tree under `/root`
- `su` for the actual build steps

Important note:
- the active supported build paths are NetBSD 7 for NetBSD 6-era devices and NetBSD 4 for older NetBSD 4-era devices
- NetBSD 10 was useful for early experiments but is not the supported Samba 4 build source path

Current validated maintainer flows:
- NetBSD 7 full path:

- NetBSD 4 little-endian SDK output defaults under `/root/tc-earmv4-netbsd4`
- NetBSD 4 big-endian SDK output defaults under `/root/tc-armeb-netbsd4`
- NetBSD 7 staged runtime outputs default under `/root/tc-netbsd7`
- NetBSD 4 little-endian staged runtime outputs default under `/root/tc-netbsd4le`
- NetBSD 4 big-endian staged runtime outputs default under `/root/tc-netbsd4be`

## Important Historical Findings

These are the findings that matter to future maintainers.

### The internal disk can be mounted locally

This was a major breakthrough. The Time Capsule can locally mount `/dev/dk2` with `mount_hfs` without needing a Mac to first trigger Apple sharing.

### Running `smbd` from the HDD is a bad idea

The HDD may be unmounted or slept by Apple later. That is why `smbd` is staged into RAM.

### Running the mDNS helper from the HDD would be less catastrophic, but we keep it off the HDD

If it died, discovery would break but file serving would remain up. The current runtime starts it from `/mnt/Flash` instead of the HDD or RAM disk, which saves RAM headroom and avoids depending on the HDD staying mounted.

### Apple’s SMB advertisement path is not a harmless metadata layer

If Apple’s own SMB/AFP stack is allowed to reclaim its native path, Finder may reconnect through Apple services rather than our Samba.

That is why we chose a separate mDNS helper.

### The Time Capsule firmware is missing small utility commands you might expect

Examples encountered during debugging:
- no `grep`
- no `dirname`
- no `find`
- no `strings`

Shell scripts must be written very conservatively.

### Non-root Unix identity handling is risky

Earlier Samba attempts on this firmware ran into privilege-switch and identity issues with non-root mappings.

That is why the current authenticated design still maps to `root`.

## Known Risks And Caveats

- This is still LAN-only software.
- The current authenticated design still maps file access to `root`.
- `/mnt/Memory` is tight; only about `1-2 MiB` may remain free after staging.
- The repo still assumes AirPort storage firmware behavior such as:
  - AirPort-style IPv4/interface layout
  - HFS partition identifiers beginning with `dk`, discovered through Apple `MaSt` metadata
  - the internal-volume `ShareRoot` layout
- Apple firmware behavior may still change runtime mount timing or disk state in edge cases.

## Verification Commands

Current useful checks from the Mac:

Browse SMB service advertisements:

```bash
dns-sd -B _smb._tcp local.
```

Resolve the SMB service:

```bash
dns-sd -L "<advertised-instance-name>" _smb._tcp local.
```

List shares as authenticated user:

```bash
smbutil view //admin:<password>@<configured-or-advertised-host>
```

Mount the share:

```bash
mount_smbfs //admin:<password>@<configured-or-advertised-host>/<share-name> /tmp/tc-auth-mount
```

Current expected result:
- `IPC$`
- at least one `MaSt`-derived share name

Expected negative test:

```bash
smbutil view //guest:@<configured-or-advertised-host>
```

That should fail with an authentication error.

## Summary

The current system is no longer just an experiment:
- it builds reproducibly
- deploys from checked-in artifacts
- survives reboot on the NetBSD 6 path
- can use the persistent firmware boot-hook patch on NetBSD 4, or be manually reactivated after reboot on tested unpatched gen1 hardware
- advertises itself over Bonjour
- authenticates with the configured password; docs and examples use SMB username `admin`
- serves the internal disk through Samba 4.25.0rc2
- supports Time Machine via `vfs_fruit`

The main remaining “nice to have” work is polish, not core functionality.
